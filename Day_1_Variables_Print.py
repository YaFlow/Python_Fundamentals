#Another Challenge
# We have 2 variables glass1 and glass2. glass1 contains milk and glass2 contains juice.
# Write 3 lines of code to switch the contents of the variables. You are not allowed to type the words "milk" or "juice".
# You are only allowed to use variables to solve this exercise.

# glass1 = "milk"
# glass2 = "juice"
#
# temporary = glass1
# glass1 = glass2
# glass2 = temporary
